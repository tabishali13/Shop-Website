# Shopping Cart Website

This web appliation is built with Javascript and the React library. It is a simple shopping cart with a navbar
that navigates to different pages. It consists of a page where there are a products that you can add to the cart. 
Each item has its own description page where you learn more about the product and can set the quantity and add to your cart.
There is also a cart page where your list of items is displayed and the total price is computed. 

## Technologies and Specification
Below are a list of tools and technologies used for this application
1. **RAWG API** A public API for different video game titles includes info: Name, Release date, images
2. **React Router** A react library used for navigating to different pages without requiring a page reload. This made
the application into a Single Page Application (SPA)
3. **React Hooks** Used various hooks like useState, useEffect, useMemo and etc
4. **Context API** This made it easier to manage state across the different components. Specifically with adding
items to the cart and other features in the cart

## Why I built this Application
I built this application to learn how to build Single Page Applications (SPA) as they are very common across 
the web. I also wanted to build an application that is on the lines of real world applications. It also
helped me improve my CSS skills by using tools like Flexbox and CSS grid to enhance the visuals of this 
application.
